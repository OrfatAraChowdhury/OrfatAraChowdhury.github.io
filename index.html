            <div class="about-content">
                
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>My name is Orfat Ara Chowdhury. I hold both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in English Language and Literature from the University of Chittagong. My academic journey has been not just about literary exploration, but also about developing strong analytical, communication, and leadership skills that I've applied beyond the classroom—especially in the realm of social change and community development.</p>
                    
                    <p>With a strong commitment to equity and empowerment, I have been actively involved in volunteer work that addresses critical societal issues. As a teaching volunteer with <strong>Campaign RED</strong>, I work to debunk deeply ingrained taboos surrounding menstruation. My focus is on educating communities, especially young people, about menstrual health and hygiene, aiming to dismantle the harmful stigmas that continue to undermine the reproductive rights and social participation of women and girls.</p>
                    
                    <p>At <strong>Shwapno Youth Development Organization</strong>, I not only volunteered in youth leadership programs but also led the Graphic Design Team, contributing to campaigns, workshops, and events that foster awareness and civic responsibility. My leadership and creativity merged here, allowing me to engage with young minds and collaborate with peers to amplify youth voices on national and international platforms.</p>
                    
                    <p>In addition, I've served as a <strong>Teaching Assistant</strong> for the <strong>Youth Society for Research and Action (YSRA)</strong>, where I supported foundational research education for students from diverse academic and cultural backgrounds. This role helped me deepen my understanding of academic research while also honing my mentoring and facilitation skills.</p>
                    
                    <p>My participation in programs such as the <strong>Youth Leadership Bootcamp</strong> by BYLC, as well as workshops on <strong>public speaking</strong>, <strong>self-defense</strong>, and <strong>debating</strong>, has enriched my confidence and equipped me with the tools to advocate for myself and others effectively.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am a strong believer in the power of knowledge-sharing and practical exposure. I aspire to work with mission-driven organizations where I can learn the intricacies of their operations, contribute meaningfully to their vision, and enhance their efficiency through innovative thinking and empathy-driven communication.</p>
                    
                    <p>Beyond academics and advocacy, I am an explorer by nature. I find peace in traveling and connecting with the world around me—be it through nature, stories, or shared experiences. Each journey inspires me to remain grounded, compassionate, and curious.</p>

                <p>Completed my part as an organizer to the program about CV Writing Hacks and Interview Tips in the title of Youth Skill Hacks 1.0 to celebrate "World Youth Skills Day 2021". During Covid-19 Pandemic, our young society moved in different directions. While many youths are developing their skills by joining different organizations, on the other hand, some are trying to set up their own businesses by opening their own Facebook page or group and spreading sales of different products. As the world celebrates World Youth Skill Day on 15th July,'Shwapno Youth Development Organization' also celebrates the day with their skillful event. To Celebrate World Youth Skill Day 2021, we organized a Training Program named ''Youth Skill Hacks 1.0''.</p>

                        <p>While I love learning new skills for fun, I learnt Graphic Design to join as a volunteer in an organization. This earned me two certificates one as a star of the month and another as a Graphic Team Leader. Learning new skills that do not always require to be used in a professional I believe. Sometimes we just want to learn a new skill just for fun. Besides, I believe in knowing the basics of skill if not mastering the skill as we don't know which knowledge would be needed in the future.</p>

                        <p>I love doing typography in my free time to post on social media though not like professional work. But I love my not so perfect work as I am a girl who loves aesthetics. It also helps me in Graphic design to modify texts even better.</p>

                        <h3>Public Speaking</h3>
                        <p>Back in school I was a quiet girl who would not speak in class even if she was told by the teachers let alone presenting assignments in front of the whole class. Though I wanted to, there would be something that would hold me back, not letting me speak in front of the whole class. As I grew up I talked to people but not as much as I should be. That was the reason to conduct this course, to overcome my fear of public speaking in a very renowned organization called BYLC.</p>
